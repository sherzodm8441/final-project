			<h2 class="love">The Solar System</h2>
			<p>It is estimated that the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a huge swirling cloud of dust called a nebula. One theory suggests that the formation of the nebula was triggered by the shockwave from an exploding supernova. As more
				and more dust accumulated in the center, its gravity increased and attracted more dust. This ball of cloud started to spin and collapsed on itself, forming a flat disc. The accumulation of more dust in the center caused the temperature to rise rapidly.
				When it got hot enough, it set off a nuclear reaction. Hydrogen atoms fused to form helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This was the birth of the sun, but it took more than 10 million years for the sun to develop and to become a recognizable
				star. The planets were formed through a process of accretion or the “coming together” of the materials. Electrostatic forces caused the dust particles to stick together, eventually they became big rocks. Gravity pulled these rocks together and over
				time it formed the 8 planets as we know them today. The leftover rocks from the formation of the solar system created the asteroid belt. The planets are divided into groups: the inner planets and the outer planets. The inner planets include Mercury,
				Venus, Earth and Mars. The outer planets include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. At the edge of the solar system there is a planet called Pluto. It was excluded from the list of the planets because it was too small to be considered as a planet,
				for that reason today Pluto is called a dwarf planet.</p>

			<h2>The Sun</h2>
			<p>The sun is located in the center of the solar system. It is a medium sized star and has a diameter of 1,390,000 kilometers. It makes up mare than 99.8% of the solar system and Jupiter contains most of the rest. Compared to other planets the sun is
				unbelievable huge. In fact it is not a big star at all. For example, let’s say that the diameter of the sun were about 3cm, then the diameter of the largest known star, would be longer than a football field. The sun’s surface temperature is lower
				than Earth’s core’s temperature, about 5,800K and the temperature at its core is more than 15,600,000K. The time it takes for the sun to complete one rotation varies depending on the parts of the sun. This happens because the outer layers are not
				solid. At the equator it takes 25.4 days to complete one rotation and near the poles it takes as much as 36 days. The sun does not have an orbit, instead other planets orbit around the sun. The sun’s energy is the result of a process called the nuclear
				fusion. Each second about 700,000,000 tons of hydrogen are converted to about 695,000,000 tons of helium and 5,000,000 tons of energy in the form of gamma rays. As the rays travel toward the surface they get absorbed and re-emitted at lower and lower
				temperatures, by the time it reaches the Earth or the other planets, they are mostly visible light. Currently the sun is about 70% hydrogen and 28% percent helium. This changes over time as the hydrogen converts into helium. The sun is made up of
				layers, as you go farther away from the core the temperature decreases. It has four layers the core, radiative zone, convection zone and photosphere the surface. The sun has a very strong and complicated magnetic field. Its magnetosphere extends beyond
				Pluto. Its magnetic field changes polarity approximately every 11 years. The convection zone inside the sun creates the magnetic field. One of the sun’s surface features associated with its magnetic field are its sunspots. They form on the photosphere
				and they are cooler than the surrounding surface, about 3,800K. Their diameter can be as much as 50,000km long. Smaller sunspots only last for hours, bigger ones can be visible for months. Scientists think that the more sunspots, the higher the temperature
				is. The sun has an atmosphere, it is composed of several layers, chromosphere and the corona. The inner layer is the chromosphere, its temperature is about 20,000C and it causes the hydrogen atoms to emit light with a reddish color. Corona is the
				outer layer, its temperature is surprisingly hot, between 1,000,000C to 3,000,000C. It is estimated that the sun will use up all of its hydrogen atoms in 5,000,000,000 years. When that happens it will turn into a Red Giant, as the name implies the
				sun will expand and swallow most of the solar system, including Earth.

		<div id="mercury">
			<h2>Mercury</h2>
			<p>Mercury is the first planet from the sun. And it is the smallest planet in the solar system with a diameter of 4,879km. It is also one of the 5 planets that can be seen with a naked eye. It is a terrestrial planet because it composed of rocky core,
				mantle and a crust. Since Mercury is closest to the sun it takes only 88 days for it to complete its orbit. But it takes 176 days for it to complete one rotation. Mercury is the second densest planet after the Earth because it is mainly composed of
				heavy metals and rocks. Its gravity is 38% of the gravity on Earth, this means that it does not an atmosphere. Solar winds constantly interact with its almost nonexistent atmosphere, they also bring and remove the gases from the atmosphere. Its atmosphere
				contains 42% oxygen, 29% sodium, 22% hydrogen (H2), 6% helium, .5% potassium, and possibly small amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, xenon, krypton, neon, calcium, and magnesium. Mercury does not have any moons or rings because of its
				weak gravity. Its orbit is the most eccentric orbit in the solar system. Despite being closest to the sun, Mercury is the second hottest planet because its atmosphere can’t hold the heat. The temperatures on the surface range from -170°C (-280°F)
				during the night to 430°C (800°F) during the day. Its magnetic field is very weak, about 1% of the magnetic field on Earth. Mercury does not have any seasons because its obliquity is very low. It has more impact craters than any other planets on the
				solar system. The largest crater on Mercury, the Caloris Basin, is around 1,550 km in diameter. By analyzing the photographs taken by satellites, scientists have concluded that the spaces between the impact craters are very smooth plains. This is
				an evidence to the existence of lava in the past. But the age of the impact craters indicate that the planet has been geologically inactive for a very long time. Mercury’s surface is also covered by cliffs (aka scarps), which are ten to thousands
				of kilometers long and up to 2km high. Formation of these cliffs imply that the Mercury’s core has been shrinking. Recent calculations show that its diameter has decreased by 1.5 kilometers. Mercury is made up of three layers: a crust, mantle, and
				core. Its crust is estimated to be between 100 and 300km in thickness and it is solid and brittle. The planets mantle is 600km in thickness, which is relatively thin. But it has not always been thin, scientists think that during the formation of the
				solar system, mercury collided with a very large object that broke most of Mercury’s mantle away. Scientists have recently settled the debate whether or not Mercury’s core is solid or liquid. By measuring how radio waves bounced off of the planet,
				scientists were able to determine that the core is, in fact, liquid.

		<div id="venus">
			<h2>Venus</h2>
			<p>Venus is the second planet from the sun and the third brightest object after the sun and the moon on Earth’s sky. It is terrestrial planet it is made up of rocks. One day on Venus is longer than a year. It takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation.
				The orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days, making a year on Venus shorter on day on Venus. It has the least eccentric and the most circular orbit in the solar system. It is sometimes referred to as the Earth’s sister planet because they have many
				similarities. The difference between their diameters is only 638km and Venus has 81% of Earth’s mass. Both of them have a core, a molten mantle, and a crust. Billions of years ago Venus’s surface may have looked like Earth’s surface. Due to high temperatures
				created by greenhouse gases, the water was evaporated and now to surface is too hot to support life. Unlike other planets, Venus rotates in clockwise. Scientists believe that its direction of rotation may have reversed after a collision with an asteroid
				or with some kind of large object. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average temperature of 462C. There is no obliquity on its axis, that means Venus has no seasons. Its atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, which traps heat and
				re-emits it back to the surface, thus rising the temperatures. Venus’s atmospheric pressure is 92 time stronger than Earth’s, and any asteroid that enters its atmosphere gets crushed. It is surprising that the magnetic field of Venus is very weak.
				One reason could be that its core is still liquid or not cooling. It has no moons nor belts. It is the closest planet to Earth, with an average distance of 41 million kilometers away. Venus’s atmosphere has two layers. First is the cloud bank that
				completely covers the planets, that is why it is nearly impossible to see the surface without entering the atmosphere. The second layer is everything below the first layer. The clouds extend from 50km to 80km from the surface, it is composed of sulphur
				dioxide (SO2) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4). These clouds reflect around 60% of the sunlight back into the space. To take pictures of the surface of the Venus, spacecrafts use radars. In 1978, it was discovered that most of the surface was flat and smooth.
				These plains were created by ancient lava flows. In 1990, more than 1000 surface craters were found. Non of then were less 2km in diameter, which suggests that any asteroid that created craters less than 2km would burn up in the atmosphere. Many shield
				volcanoes can found on the surface of the planet. Venus also has a different type of volcanoes called pancake volcanoes. These volcanoes are believed to be formed when an eruption forces out all of volcano’s lava at once through a single vent, this
				caused lava to spread evenly and form a flat disc. It is believed that Venus’ crust is 50 km thick, its mantle 3,000 km thick, and the core has a diameter of 6,000 km. These calculations were based on the similarities of Earth and Venus. People still
				debate whether or not the core is liquid or solid.</p>

			<h2>Earth</h2>
			<p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets. It is a terrestrial planet because it is made up rocks, metals and all types of solid materials. It is also the densest planet in the solar system, the average density
				of the planet is around 5.52 grams per cubic centimeter. The gravity between Earth and the Moon causes tides. The Moon is the planet’s only natural satellite. Earth’s rotational speed slowing down 17 milliseconds every hundred years. Currently, it
				completes one rotation every 24 (23h 56mins) hours. In 140 million years, the Earth will complete one rotation every 25 hours. Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on its axis, this tilt creates for seasons. It completes its orbit in just over 365 days (365
				¼ days). Large amounts of oxygen on Earth is mostly produced by plants through the process of photosynthesis. Earth’s magnetic field is very powerful, it protects the planet from the effects of solar winds and is believed to be a result of the nickel-iron
				core of the planet. The first life formed in the oceans around 3.8 billion years ago through a process called abiogenesis or biopoiesis. Earth’s water was trapped under the surface when it first formed. It was brought to the surface by volcanic activity.
				Earth’s orbit is one of the least eccentric orbits in the solar system. The highest point on the surface is the summit of the Mount Everest. It is 8.8 kilometers above the sea level. The lowest point on Earth is called the Challenger Deep, and it
				is 10.9 kilometers below the sea level. Earth’s atmosphere is the combination of all types of gases that enables it to support life. It consists of 78% nitrogen (N2), 21% oxygen (O2), 1% argon, with trace amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other
				gases. Nitrogen and oxygen are important for the creation of life on Earth. The ozone layer is a special type of oxygen that protects the surface from the sun’s harmful UV rays. The oceans cover approximately 70% of the Earth’s surface. Water came
				from two places, the first source is inside Earth, it was trapped in the form of water vapor rather than liquid due to the fact that it was hot inside Earth. The second source were the comets. Since they are mostly composed of ice water, when it entered
				the atmosphere the ice melted and turned into liquid water. The surface of the Earth barely has any impact craters, it is because the Earth is geologically active and it erased most of the impact craters. One way would be the volcanic activity, lava
				flows over the craters and fills them up, thus completely erasing it from the surface of the planet. Other ways would be by weathering and erosion. Movement of the tectonic plates also contribute to the disappearance of the craters. This is not the
				only thing that they contribute to, they also completely reshape the surface of the planet. For example, about 250 million years ago, the Earth did not look the way that it looks now. There weren’t any continents, instead there was a huge single land
				mass called the Pangea. The interior of the planet consists of a core, a mantle and a crust. The core itself has 2 layers, the inner layer is made up of solid nickel and iron and the outer layer is composed of molten nickel and iron. The mantle is
				very dense and solid and almost entirely solid silicate rock, but it has properties of liquid materials. Its thickness is around 2,850km. The crust is also composed of silicate rock, the thickness ranges from 30 to 40 kilometers.

			<h2>Mars</h2>
			<p>Mars is the 4th planet from the Sun after Earth. And it has two moons called the Deimos and Phobos. Its axis is tilted by 25.19 degrees, similar to Earth’s. This tilt creates 4 seasons, just like how the Earth has 4 seasons. Unlike Earth, Mars’s obliquity
				(tilt) does not stay the same, it changes over time. Thus, changing the severity of the seasons. It takes Mars 24.6229 hours to complete one rotation on its axis. In Earth days it would be a day and 37 minutes. Mars’s revolution period is 686 days
				in Earth days. Since it takes nearly two years, the seasons last about 6 months each. Mars’s orbit is the 2nd most eccentric in the solar system. About 1.5 million years ago, its orbit was nearly circular, because the eccentricity of an orbit can
				vary depending on the gravitational forces around it. At perihelion Mars is 206,655,215 km from the Sun and at aphelion it is 249,232,432 km. This big difference between the perihelion and the aphelion unbalances the seasons. Mars’s magnetic field
				is weak, about 0.2% of that of the Earth’s. Because of that, it’s atmosphere is also thin. This kind of atmosphere cannot protect the surface from harmful rays that are coming from the sun. Also, the solar winds interact with the planet’s ionosphere
				because its weak global magnetic field, radiation belts have not formed. It is estimated that solar winds remove as much as 30,000 tons of atmospheric gases from Mars each year. Mars’s atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth’s and 95% of
				it is carbon dioxide and only 0.13% is oxygen. Other types if gases include nitrogen, argon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, neon, hydrogen-deuterium-oxygen, krypton and xenon. Mars’s surface temperature varies from season to season. On a summer
				day, the surface can get as warm as 27C, but on a winter night the temperature drops as low as -125C. Mars is a terrestrial planet. The difference between Jovian and terrestrial planets are that the Jovian planets are made up of all different types
				of gases. Terrestrial planets consist of rocks, only their atmospheres contains gases. Mars is also made up rocks and has layers. The layers include the crust, upper mantle, lower mantle and the core. Mars has many interesting surface features, one
				of would be its volcanoes. Volcanic activities on the surface have stopped very long time ago. But the results of these volcanic activities are huge shield volcanoes. The largest volcano on the surface of the Mars is the Olympus Mons. Olympus Mons
				is 600 km across its base and about 25 km above the surrounding plain. It is 2 and a half times the height of the Mount Everest. There is a reason for why the volcanoes have become so large on the Martian surface. Mars has not shown any evidence of
				plate tectonics or their movement. This allowed the magma to flow out from one place for a long time. Because of the plate tectonics and their movement the volcanoes on the Earth’s surface are much smaller. Astronomers have discovered large canyons
				on Mars’s surface. The largest is Valles Marineris, which extends for about 5000 km, is 500 km wide and as much as 6km deep. It is believed that these canyons were formed by local tectonic activity rather than water. Another very interesting feature
				is that the wind erosion. It occurs when the sun heats the surface and the winds start to move to a different place. Movement of the air produces dust storms that lead to a lot of erosion. Mars’s poles have ice caps that are partially composed frozen
				carbon dioxide and water. These ice caps shrink and expand depending on the season. Mars has many craters on its surface. Mars is about half (53 percent) the size of Earth, but because Mars is a desert planet, it has the same amount of dry land as
				Earth. Mars has a diameter of 4,222 miles (6,794 km), but from pole to pole, the diameter is 4,196 miles (6,752 km), because Mars is an oblate spheroid just like Earth. There are channels on Mars as much as 1500 km long and 200 km wide that appear
				to have been created by running water. Currently water cannot exist in a liquid state because of the conditions of its atmosphere. Water erosion evidence suggests that the Mars might have a thicker atmosphere in the past. According to NASA, about
				20% of Mars’s surface was covered by an ocean on the Northern Hemisphere. Mars started to dry up about 3.7 billion years ago. It is estimated that the Mars has lost about 87% of its water, the other percentage remains in the ice caps. Not all of the
				water escaped into the space, because the water with the lighter hydrogen atoms was able to escape. Water molecules with deuterium was not able to escape because deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen.

			<h2>Jupiter</h2>
			<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun. It is also the largest planet in the solar system. It would take 317 Earth’s to equal Jupiter’s mass. It has a diameter of 139,822 km. If it were 80 times more massive than it is now, nuclear fusion would have
				occurred and Jupiter would have been a star rather than a planet. One day on Jupiter is shorter than any other planet’s one day. It takes the planet only 9 hours and 55 minutes to complete one rotation. This rapid rotation causes the planet to form
				an oblate spheroid, just like Earth. To complete a single orbit around the sun it take Jupiter 11.86 years. Its orbit elliptical, just like other planets orbits. The gravity on Jupiter is very strong. It has a thin ring system and over 60 confirmed
				moons. The largest of them are Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa, Ganymede is larger than the planet Mercury with a diameter of around 5,268 km. If Ganymede were caught in the sun’s gravity instead of Jupiter’s it would have been a planet. It is also
				the only moon in the solar system to generate its own magnetic field. Jupiter’s ring system is mainly composed of dust particles that came from the impacts between Jupiter’s moons and asteroids. Jupiter has a very powerful magnetic field, it is 14
				times stronger than Earth’s. Its average surface temperature is -108C. It is the forth brightest object in the Earth’s sky and it can be seen without any gadgets telescopes. This planet does not experience any seasons because its orbit is only tilted
				by 3.13 degrees. Jupiter is a Jovian planet because it is primarily made up of gases. Its atmosphere is divided by horizontal lines that run across the face of the planet. Each of these lines divide the layers of high pressure from the layers of lows
				pressure. Usually storms develop on those horizontal lines. The Great Red Spot is an example of such storms. It has been visible on the “surface” of the planet for many centuries. With its 25,000 kilometer diameter, it can hold three Earths. The composition
				of Jupiter’s atmosphere supports the theory that it could have been a star. Its atmosphere is composed of 90% hydrogen and 10% helium, nearly the same as the Sun’s. Jupiter is believed to have 3 layers. The inner layer is its core, it is composed
				of many types of elements with a mass between 12 and 45 times that of the entire Earth. The middle layer consists of electrically conductive liquid hydrogen. The upper layer is mostly ordinary hydrogen with traces of helium. One interesting feature
				of Jupiter is that it radiates more energy out into space than it receives from the sun. This happens because Jupiter exerts its gravitational forces on itself, then the compression creates a lot of heat energy that gets radiated into space.

			<h2>Saturn</h2>
			<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest planet in the Solar System in terms of diameter and mass. It is also the flattest planet because it is the least dense planet in the solar system. Its rotational speed in another factor. Saturn
				completes one rotation every 10 hours and 34 minutes. It takes Saturn 29.4 years to orbit the sun and its orbit is eccentric. The gravity on Saturn is strong. It has over 30 rings, they extend up to 12,700 km from the planet but are only 20 meters
				thick. Saturn and Jupiter have many similarities; similar size, composition, gravity, mass and etc. It has nearly 60 confirmed moons, five largest ones are Titan, Enceladus, Rhea, Mimas, and Dione. Titan is the second largest moon is the solar system,
				it has a dense atmosphere that is made mostly of nitrogen and is composed from water ice and rock. Its frozen surface covered with frozen nitrogen and has liquid methane lakes. It possible that some kind of life has developed there. The magnetic field
				on Saturn is slightly weaker than Earth’s. Combined masses of Saturn and Jupiter make up 92% percent of the solar system’s planetary mass. The temperature of the interior of the planet is very hot, it can reach temperatures of up to 11,700°C (21,000
				°F). Saturn is 1,424,600,000 km from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a Jovian planet and is made up of gases. But it is believed to a solid rocky core. Its storms form in an oval shape which are similar to those of Jupiter. The wind in its atmosphere
				could reach speeds of up to 2000 km/h, fastest wind speeds of any other planet. The planet’s pale yellow color comes from ammonia crystals. The ammonia clouds are mainly made up of water ice. Saturn’s atmosphere is composed of 96% hydrogen and 4%
				helium, with trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, phosphine and methane. It has a thickness of approximately 60 km. Telescopes have captured pictures of white spots, these are the planet’s storms. The inner composition of Saturn is believed
				very similar to Jupiter’s. It has a solid core, surrounded by liquid metallic hydrogen. The outer layer is composed of ordinary hydrogen. Saturn, like Jupiter, emits 2.5 times energy into space than it receives from the sun. Its internal energy also
				comes from its gravitational compression. Additional heat is generated from the friction of helium rain in its atmosphere. Despite being the 2nd largest planet and having a very dense and solid core, Saturn has the lowest density. It is even lower
				than water density, if there was an ocean bigger than Saturn, Saturn would float on it.</p>

			<h2>Uranus</h2>
			<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the third of the Jovian planet. It has a diameter of 51,118 km and is the third largest planet in the solar system. The mass of Uranus is about 14.5 times the mass of Earth. It takes Uranus 17 hours and
				14 minutes to rotate on its orbit. Like Venus, it rotates in a retrograde direction or clockwise. One surprising fact about Uranus is that its axis is tilted by 98 degrees, which means it almost lies sideways as it rotates and orbits the Sun. Uranus
				orbits the sun every 84 years. Its tilt causes one side of the planet to receive sunlight for 42 years and causes the other side to remain in darkness for 42 years. Scientists believe that the planet’s unusual tilt was caused by a collision with an
				Earth sized object. Wind speeds can reach up to 900 km per hour. Uranus is the 2nd least dense planet in the solar system. It has a strong gravity, that holds 13 rings. It also has 27 known moons, one of the moons is called Miranda. Its has ice canyons,
				terraces and many strange looking surface area. The rings are believed to have formed after the shattered pieces of the moons got caught in Uranus’s gravity. Uranus is also called the ice giant because it contains a lot of ice and it is the coldest
				planet in the solar system. Its average surface temperature is -224°C. Observing Uranus’s atmospheric is difficult due to the upper layer of the atmosphere. It contains methane gas that only reflects the color blue making it nearly impossible to see
				the lower parts of the atmosphere. The lower atmosphere is made up of 83% hydrogen (H2) and 15% helium with trace amounts of methane and acetylene. The composition of Uranus is similar to that of other gas giants. But Uranus is extremely cold, the
				cold temperatures are uniform throughout the planet. The side that is facing away from the sun has the same temperature as the side that is facing the sun. One theory suggests that something is blocking its internal heat from reaching the surface
				or a collision between a large body and the Uranus caused it lose its heat that was retained from its formation. Unlike other Jovian planets, Uranus is believed to be composed of 2 layers: a core and mantle. The core is primarily composed of rock
				and ice and is approximately .55 times the mass of the Earth. The planet’s mantle is about 13.4 times the mass of the Earth. The mantle is composed of water, ammonia and other elements. What makes Uranus’s mantle different from those of Jupiter and
				Saturn is that it is icy, but the ice is very hot and thick.</p>

			<h2>Neptune</h2>
			<p>Neptune is the eighth and the last planet from the sun. Like the other outer planets, Neptune also is a Jovian planet. It has a diameter of 49,528 km and is the third largest in terms of mass. Neptune experiences seasons because its axis it tilted.
				The tilt of Neptune’s axis is 28.32 degrees, very similar to those of the Earth and Mars. The planet has a magnetic field and it is tilted by 46 degrees. Since Neptune is not a solid body, its equatorial clouds take 18 hours to complete one rotation.
				It takes Neptune 164.8 years to orbit the sun. In 2011 it completed one full orbit since its discovery in 1846. Its orbit is eccentric like all the other planets’ orbits are. Neptune has the second strongest gravity after Jupiter. It has a ring system
				and 14 known moons. It has 5 confirmed rings and the largest of its moons it Triton. Triton’s surface is frozen and it spits out particles of nitrogen ice and dust from below its surface. The ring system is most likely made up of ice particles and
				grains of dust. Neptune has an average surface temperature of -214°C, making it one of the coldest places in the solar system. It is approximately 30 astronomical units away from the sun or 4,498,396,441 kilometers. Neptune’s mass is 17.5 times the
				Earth’s mass. Neptune’s atmosphere is composed of 80% hydrogen (H2), 19% helium and trace amounts of methane. Like Uranus, its upper atmosphere is blue due to the presence of the gas methane, but it is darker blue, which indicates that the upper atmosphere
				contains other gases besides methane. Many storms occur on Neptune, just like the Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. Neptune’s storms are called the Dark Spots, unlike Jupiter’s storms, these storms only last for couple of years. Another type of weather pattern
				that occurs on Neptune is the swiftly moving white storm system. Like the first time of storms, this storm system has a short duration too. In its atmosphere winds can reach up to 600 meters per second. The interior of Neptune is similar to Uranus’s
				interior; it is composed of a core and a mantle. Its core is rocky and is 1.2 times the size of the Earth. The mantle is an extremely hot and dense liquid and is composed of water. It is estimated to be 10 to 15 times the mass of the Earth. Neptune
				radiates 2.61 times the amount energy it receives from the sun back into the space. It has an internal heat source, this energy helps the atmosphere create the upper atmosphere winds.
